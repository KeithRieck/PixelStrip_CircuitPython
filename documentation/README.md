# PixelStrip_CircuitPython

PixelStrip is a [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) module for controlling WS2812 RGB LEDs.  These LEDs are also known as [NeoPixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide). The PixelStrip library allows you to add Animations to the strip.  Multiple strips can have separate animations that run in parallel.
